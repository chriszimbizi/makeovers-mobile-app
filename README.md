# Makeovers Mobile App Landing Page

Welcome to the Makeovers Mobile App Landing Page repository! This project represents the culmination of our group capstone project, where we have built a responsive landing page for the Makeovers app using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.

## Introduction

The Makeovers app is an innovative online marketplace that connects Home Builders with customers, offering services similar to the well-known platform [Kandua](https://kandua.com/). Our goal for this capstone project was to create an engaging landing page that effectively showcases the features and benefits of the Makeovers app. We have worked collaboratively in pairs to bring this project to life.

## Objective

The objective of our project was twofold. Firstly, we aimed to showcase our skills in front-end web development, specifically in building responsive landing pages using Bootstrap. This project allowed us to demonstrate our proficiency in HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, as well as our understanding of design principles and attention to detail.

Secondly, we wanted to gain experience in collaborative work by pairing up and working together effectively. Throughout the project, we embraced the challenges and rewards of pair programming, learning how to communicate, share ideas, and divide tasks efficiently. This experience has helped us develop valuable teamwork skills that are highly sought after in the industry.

## Requirements

To meet the project requirements, we focused on the following aspects:

### Design
We were provided with a design mockup of the Makeovers landing page, and our task was to replicate the design faithfully using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. Our attention to detail and commitment to visual consistency ensured that the final landing page closely resembled the provided design.

### Responsiveness
Creating a responsive design was a crucial aspect of this project. We ensured that the landing page adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, including desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. By utilizing Bootstrap's responsive grid system and media queries, we achieved an optimal user experience across various devices.

### Content
We incorporated engaging and persuasive content throughout the landing page to effectively showcase the features, benefits, and functionality of the Makeovers app. Our content highlights the value proposition of the app, captivating potential users and encouraging them to explore further.

### Forms
To facilitate user registration and account creation, we implemented user signup forms using HTML. These forms securely capture the necessary user information, ensuring a smooth onboarding experience for new users of the Makeovers app.

### Navigation
To enhance user experience and improve navigation within the landing page, we strategically placed navigation links that enable users to move seamlessly between different sections. This intuitive navigation design allows visitors to explore the app's offerings and quickly find the information they need.

## Conclusion

We are proud to present the completed Makeovers Mobile App Landing Page, a testament to our skills, dedication, and teamwork. This project has allowed us to showcase our front-end web development abilities, particularly in building responsive landing pages using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. Moreover, the experience of collaborating in pairs has strengthened our communication, problem-solving, and collaborative skills.
